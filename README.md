# SQL data projects

This repository contains small SQL projects focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and SQL-based insights. It serves as a personal learning space where I analyze different datasets, experiment with SQL techniques, and explore real-world data challenges.

Not all projects here are perfect - some datasets contained logical inconsistencies or unrealistic records, making them a great learning experience in data validation and anomaly detection.
